## Iris Flower Sepcies Prediction

The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

This dataset became a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning such as support vector machines

#### Requirements
* Have Python 3.5 or newer installed. You can check the version by typing `python3 --version` in your command line. You can download the latest Python version from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* Have [Jupyter Notebook installed](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

If you can not access Python and/or Jupyter Notebook on your machine, you can still follow the web based materials. However, you should be able to use Jupyter Notebook in order to complete the exercises.

#### Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Checkout a new branch `training/<exercise_name>/<employee_id>/<employee_name>`
3. Run `jupyter notebook` command in your command line in the repository directory.
4. Jupyter Notebook session will open in the browser and you can start navigating through the materials.
5. Dataset is available under the folder 'dataset'
6. After finding the solutions, create a Pull Request for review.
